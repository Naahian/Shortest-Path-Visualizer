## Shortest Path Visualizer
(under development, currently has DFS, BFS)<br>
Simulation of SSSP(Single source shortest path) algorithoms.Includes:<br>
- BFS (garantees shortest path)
- DFS (doesnot garantee shortest path)
- Dijkstra (garantees shortest path)
- A* (fastest, garantees shortest path)
### Documentation:
- `LEFT CLICK` to make obstacle
- `RIGHT CLICK` to create start and end node
- press `R` for random maze
- press `C` to clear canvas
### To Run
install `pygame` pacakge
